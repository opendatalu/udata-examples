# Examples of use of the udata API in Python

[Data.public.lu](https://data.public.lu) relies on the [udata platform](https://github.com/opendatateam/udata) and provides an [API](https://data.public.lu/fr/docapi/) to access to most of the features of the platform.

This repository contains a few examples of usage of this API based on common use cases:

- [get the latest resource from a dataset (notebook)](getLatestResourceFromDataset.ipynb)
- [add a resource to a Dataset (notebook)](addResourceToDataset.ipynb)
- [download all files from a Dataset](downloadAllFilesFromDataset.py)

# Installation

This code requires the Python environment. All the dependencies can be installed with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The notebook files require [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or any compatible platform.
